# push_swap
*Because Swap_push isn’t as natural*

Summary:
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

# Usage
```bash
$ make
$ ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```
Checker:
```bash
$ make bonus
$ ./checker 4 67 3 87 23
```

Benchmark:
- sorts 100 numbers on average in **550** moves, goal was <700
- sorts 500 numbers on average in **4900** moves, goal was <5500
